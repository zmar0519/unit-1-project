## Getting Started
### Background
Quizes were invented in 1849 by Henry H. Quiz. Quiz was a descendant of Peter Test who famously invented the Test. Ever since then the quiz has had many different forms and thanks to the invention of the internet we can now take tests over the world-wide-web. Had it not been for the hard work of these founders the ability to play quiz games like this would not be possible.

### Instructions
Trivia Mania will load and prompt you to select the category you would like to answer question in. Upon selecting a categroy a question will appear. Under the question you will have 3 potential answers with a single correct. Select the answer that you believe is correct and you will be prompted with the next question. A total of ten questions will appear per quiz. For each question that you get right you will be award 10 points for a total possible scrore of 100. Any wrong questions will not receive any points. Be Quick! You only have 100 seconds to answer all 10 questions. If you fail to answer all the questions within the 100 seconds you will automatically brought to the end screen and the score you have at that time will be the score you are stuck with!

The categories available are movie, coding, history, science or random. If you select random then questions will be pulled randomly from all the categories.

# Project Overview
Thank you for checking out my Unit 1 Project. This is a culmination of my skills from the past three weeks of learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Dev Tools, and version control. This project is part of my journey through the General Assembly SEI program.

This game is a classic example of a quiz/trivia game demonstrating what I have learned over the past several weeks.

This game specifically uses the following technology:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Git
